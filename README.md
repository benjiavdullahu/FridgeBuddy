- **Technology Stack**: Built with React Native, Expo, SQLite for local storage, and integrates with TheMealDB API. Features include:
  - Camera integration for food item capture
  - Local database for offline capability
  - Push notifications system
  - RESTful API integration for recipes

## Local Development
- **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Node.js, npm, and Expo CLI installed.
- **Setup**:
  1. Clone the repository
  2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
  3. Start the Expo development server: `npm start`
  4. Use Expo Go app on your mobile device or an emulator to run the application

## Database Schema
The app uses SQLite for local storage with the following structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE items (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    expiry_date TEXT NOT NULL,
    image_uri TEXT,
    category TEXT,
    notes TEXT
);
```

## API Integration
Recipe data is fetched from TheMealDB API:
```javascript
const fetchRecipesByIngredients = async (ingredients) => {
    const response = await fetch(
        `https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?i=${ingredients}`
    );
    return await response.json();
};
```
